  Documentation generator, maintainer, and impact auditor for the Luke
  monorepo. Four modes: readme (creates/updates the root README.md,
  apps/*/README.md, packages/*/README.md and docs/README.md, with luke-docs
  markers), inline (JSDoc on TypeScript exports, tRPC procedure comments,
  Prisma /// field docs), adr (validates docs/decisions/ ADRs against the
  codebase and maintains the index), audit (read-only documentation-impact
  and semantic-drift review). Use when asked to generate, update, normalize,
  or review documentation, and after changes to architecture, public/API
  behavior, configuration, operations, release/deployment, developer
  workflows, or repository structure. One mode per invocation.

# Luke Docs — Documentation generator, maintainer, and impact auditor

Four modes:

| Mode     | What it does                                                                                       | Details reference                |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `readme` | Creates/updates root `README.md`, `apps/*/README.md`, `packages/*/README.md`, `docs/README.md`       | `references/readme-templates.md` |
| `inline` | Normalizes source-code comments: JSDoc on TS exports, tRPC comments, Prisma field docs (`///`)       | `references/inline-rules.md`     |
| `adr`    | Validates the ADRs in `docs/decisions/` against the codebase, reports conflicts, maintains the index | `references/adr-rules.md`        |
| `audit`  | Audits documentation impact and semantic drift; reads and reports, but never writes                 | `references/audit-rules.md`      |

## Mode resolution — before anything else

**Invocation arguments:** $ARGUMENTS

Resolve the value above **first**: before reading any repository file, any
file in `references/`, the shared protocol, or running any git command. The
first whitespace-separated token is the mode. **One mode runs per invocation**
— there is no combined run; running all four modes requires four separate
invocations.

`<write-mode>` below is exactly `readme`, `inline`, or `adr`, case-sensitive.
Exactly these forms are accepted, in this order and no other:

| Form                                          | Effect                                        |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `<write-mode>`                                | shared-protocol default scope                 |
| `<write-mode> --dry-run`                      | default scope, plan only                      |
| `<write-mode> --since <ref>`                  | files changed relative to `<ref>`             |
| `<write-mode> --since <ref> --dry-run`        | changed files, plan only                      |
| `<write-mode> <path>`                         | the owned target below `<path>`               |
| `<write-mode> <path> --dry-run`               | path-scoped plan only                         |
| `<write-mode> <path> --since <ref>`           | intersection of path and changed files        |
| `<write-mode> <path> --since <ref> --dry-run` | path-and-diff scoped plan only                |
| `audit`                                       | read-only audit on the shared default scope   |
| `audit --since <ref>`                         | read-only audit of files changed from `<ref>` |
| `audit <path>`                                | read-only audit below `<path>`                |
| `audit <path> --since <ref>`                  | read-only audit of the path/diff intersection |
| `audit --full`                                | read-only audit of the governed corpus        |

`<path>` and `<ref>` are each one token not starting with `--`. A path is
repository-relative, contains no `..` segment, and is accepted only when it
maps to the selected mode's ownership row below. Whether a path exists and
whether git can resolve a ref are checked later, before any write. Flag order
is fixed: the optional path precedes `--since <ref>`, which precedes
`--dry-run`. Quoting is not supported, so paths or refs containing whitespace
are not accepted. `--full` is exclusive to `audit`; `--dry-run` is exclusive
to the three write modes because `audit` is already read-only.

**Anything else fails closed.** Print

```
luke-docs: usage — <readme|inline|adr> [<path>] [--since <ref>] [--dry-run] | audit [<path>] [--since <ref>] | audit --full
```

and stop, having read nothing and written nothing:

| Case                               | Example                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| no mode                            | bare invocation, or `--dry-run` alone                         |
| unknown or differently-cased mode | `readm`, `ADR`, `Readme`, `all`                               |
| a flag before the mode            | `--dry-run readme`                                            |
| an unowned path                   | `readme docs/decisions/README.md`, `inline README.md`          |
| more than one positional path     | `readme apps/api packages/core`                               |
| an unknown or mode-invalid flag   | `readme --full`, `audit --dry-run`, `readme --force`           |
| a duplicated flag                 | `readme --dry-run --dry-run`                                  |
| `--since` without a value         | `readme --since`, `readme --since --dry-run`                   |
| reverse flag order                | `readme --dry-run --since HEAD~1`                             |
| tokens after the accepted form    | `readme packages/core --since HEAD~1 --dry-run extra`          |

## File ownership per mode

**Mode selection bounds what you write, never what you read.** Read whatever
the mode needs; write only the paths in its row.

| Mode     | Writes — and only these                                                                                                                                                                          | Never                                                                                                                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `readme` | root `README.md`; `apps/*/README.md`; `packages/*/README.md`; `docs/README.md` — inside the markers, or the whole file when it does not exist                                                      | `docs/decisions/README.md` (owned by `adr`); any README nested deeper than one level, until an explicit decision adds it   |
| `inline` | comments in `packages/**/src/**/*.ts`, `apps/web/src/lib/**/*.ts`, `apps/web/src/hooks/**/*.ts`, `apps/api/src/routers/**/*.ts`, `packages/db/prisma/*.prisma`, per `references/inline-rules.md` | every README; anything under `docs/`; any change to executable behaviour                                                   |
| `adr`    | `docs/decisions/README.md`; the `Status` line(s) of explicitly named ADR files, and only on an explicit user decision                                                                             | `docs/README.md` (owned by `readme`); ADR Context / Decision / Consequences, always manual                                 |
| `audit`  | nothing — its report exists only in the session                                                                                                                                                   | every repository file and every tracked report                                                                            |

Rule 7's never-touch list below wins over every row.

A file outside your row that looks like it needs the work — a README under
`docs/decisions/` carrying markers, an ADR title disagreeing with the index, a
JSDoc gap noticed while reading `src/index.ts` — is **reported, not edited**:
list it in the final report as `owned by <mode>, not touched`. Noticing is not
authority to write.

**Before running the mode, read its file in `references/`** — it contains
templates, merge logic, and mandatory quality checklists.

**Also read `.claude/skills/luke-shared/audit-protocol.md`** and apply the
sections its applicability table assigns to the selected mode. §1 scoping and
§7 concurrent sessions apply to all four modes; §7.2 applies only to the three
write modes. The findings-related sections apply only to `audit`, as the shared
table records. The grammar above deliberately narrows the shared selectors:
`--full` is read-only and audit-only, while a write-mode path must map to that
mode's ownership row. No invocation regenerates the whole documentation tree in
one pass.

**Ownership**: `.claude/skills/luke-shared/governance-map.md`. This skill owns
documentation impact and semantic documentation drift, plus generated README,
JSDoc, Prisma field docs, and the ADR index. It owns no code-compliance,
architectural, or platform decision. Within it, write ownership is per mode:
the table above is where that is written, and every other statement points here.

---

## Mandatory rules (take precedence over everything else)

1. **Read before write** — in a write mode, never generate content for a file
   without having read it first. `audit` never writes.
2. **No SQL, no migrations, no test runner** — the `packages/db/prisma/*.prisma`
   files are read as text; never `prisma migrate/generate`, `pnpm db:*`, `pnpm test`.
3. **Parallel agents: max 3** simultaneously.
4. **Preserve markers** — never overwrite content outside the
   `luke-docs:start/end` markers. Marker integrity, internal-link resolution,
   and README-rooted reachability are **not** verified here:
   `tools/scripts/check-docs-integrity.ts` checks them, blocking in CI. It's
   pure parsing, and parsing entrusted to an LLM is a level-4 control where a
   level-2 one is enough.
5. **Dry-run** — in a write mode, `--dry-run` prints the plan without writing
   any file. `audit --dry-run` is invalid because `audit` is always read-only.
6. **No placeholders** — never `TBD`, `TODO`, `…`, `{to be filled in}` in
   generated text. If information is missing: omit the section and flag it
   in the report.
7. **Never touch**: `.planning/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `lessons.md`, `lessons-archive.md`.
   Never change an ADR's `Status` without an explicit user decision.
8. **No volatile platform facts in generated text** — a framework or tool is
   named, never versioned. Versions are read from the manifests at the moment
   anyone needs them (`.claude/skills/luke-deps/references/platform-policy.md`).
   A README that states a version is a second source of truth that drifts: the
   template here said `Next.js 15` while `apps/web` was on 16.
9. **Always a final report** — files created/updated/unchanged for write modes,
   findings for `audit`, what stayed out of mode, and flagged issues. One block,
   for the mode that ran; see the report section below.
10. **Commit suggestion** at the end — the one for the write mode that ran,
    from the report table. `audit` reports `none — read-only audit`. Never name
    a mode that did not run.

## Language

All generated or updated technical prose is English. The canonical rule,
including the temporary product-UI exception and the treatment of frozen
historical material, is in `CLAUDE.md`; its rationale is ADR-015. This skill
implements that policy and does not restate or extend it.

---

## Scope resolution

After the grammar is accepted, resolve the selector through
`audit-protocol.md` §1. An explicit selector always wins; never derive the
default diff first.

**Path validation for write modes is fail-closed:**

- `readme` accepts `README.md`; `apps/<workspace>` or its `README.md`;
  `packages/<workspace>` or its `README.md`; and `docs` or `docs/README.md`.
  The workspace directory must contain a tracked `package.json`. A directory
  maps to its one owned README; it does not recursively select nested READMEs.
- `inline` accepts only a file or directory inside the source roots in the
  ownership row. After recursive expansion, every selected file must match an
  owned `.ts` or `.prisma` pattern.
- `adr` accepts only `docs/decisions`, its `README.md`, or one tracked
  `NNN-*.md` ADR. Selecting one ADR still permits regenerating the one shared
  index; it never permits changing that ADR's Context, Decision, or
  Consequences. A `Status` line changes only on an explicit user decision, per
  the ownership table.
- `audit` accepts any existing repository-relative file or directory because
  code can create documentation impact. It writes nothing. `audit --full`
  selects the governed Markdown corpus and reads code only as evidence.

Reject absolute paths, `.` or an empty path token, `..` segments, paths outside
the repository, and paths that do not satisfy the selected mode's rule. Do not
reinterpret a rejected path as a default-scope invocation.

For `--since <ref>`, first require git to resolve `<ref>`, then derive changed
paths with `git diff --name-only <ref> HEAD`. A path plus `--since` is the
intersection of that list and the validated path. For the default and
`--since`-only scopes, the mode maps resolved paths to targets:

- `inline`: owned `.ts` and `.prisma` files only;
- `readme`: a workspace README when that workspace is selected; root
  `README.md` when a root manifest or any workspace is selected; and
  `docs/README.md` when a document below `docs/` is selected;
- `adr`: ADRs whose decisions bear on the selected changes, plus the index;
- `audit`: governed documentation affected by the selected code or document
  paths, with directly relevant code and authorities read as evidence.

An explicit `readme <path>` selects only the README mapped from that path,
including a missing owned README. It never adds other missing READMEs. An
explicit `adr <ADR path>` validates only that ADR and maintains the index.

No relevant path after resolution → stop with
`No relevant file in the resolved scope. Nothing to do.` and write nothing.

---

## `readme` mode

**Phase 1 — Explore (mandatory).** Read in order:

1. Root `package.json` (workspaces, scripts, engines) + `turbo.json`
2. For every workspace: `package.json`, `src/index.ts(x)`, existing `README.md`
3. `.env.production.example` + env policy in `CLAUDE.md` — env var catalog
   (enforcement is `assertEnvPolicy()` in `apps/api/src/server.ts`)
4. `packages/db/prisma/*.prisma` — model names only (multi-file schema, split by domain)
5. `apps/api/src/routers/` — list of router files (names, not content)
6. `apps/web/src/app/` — 2-level directory tree
7. `docs/` — recursive listing of `.md` files (H1 titles, path). Input for
   `docs/README.md` only: the ADR titles it surfaces belong to `adr` mode, and
   noticing that `docs/decisions/README.md` disagrees with them is a report
   line, not work for this mode
8. `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — only to understand direction (don't reproduce)

Build a dictionary: `workspace → { name, description, dependents[], envVars[], exports[], scripts[], routerNamespaces[] }`.

**Phase 2 — Generate README** using the templates in
`references/readme-templates.md`, and no other README, in this order: root +
apps (max 3 in parallel) → packages (max 3 in parallel) → `docs/README.md`.
The order is fixed; the membership is not — regenerate only the targets the
resolved scope selected. A missing README is created only when its workspace is
selected by the resolved scope. An explicit path selects exactly one target.

**Phase 3 — Semantic consistency:** package names in "Used by"/"Internal
dependencies" match the real names; sections omitted for missing information
are flagged in the report.

Link resolution, marker integrity, and README-rooted reachability are **not**
to be verified by hand: `pnpm check:drift` checks them in CI. If it fails, the
link must be fixed or removed — never added to an exceptions list, or the
checker becomes furniture.

---

## `inline` mode

**Phase 1 — Audit (mandatory).** Build the target list:

- `packages/**/src/**/*.ts`: exports without JSDoc, drifted JSDoc, `//` on public exports
- `apps/web/src/lib/**/*.ts` and `apps/web/src/hooks/**/*.ts`: same treatment
  (`references/inline-rules.md` holds the boundary — not `components`, not `app`)
- `apps/api/src/routers/**/*.ts`: procedures without `/** */` or without input/output/RBAC permission
- `packages/db/prisma/*.prisma`: fields and models without `///`

**Phase 2-4 — Write** following the templates and merge logic in
`references/inline-rules.md`: package JSDoc (max 3 in parallel) → tRPC
comments (max 3 routers in parallel) → Prisma field docs.

---

## `adr` mode

**Phase 1 — Discover:** read the files in `docs/decisions/`; for each one
extract the title, `Status`, and key statements from the Decision section.
If `docs/decisions/` doesn't exist: flag it in the report and stop.

**Phase 2 — Validate** against the codebase (max 3 ADRs in parallel) per
`references/adr-rules.md`. **Change no `Status` field.** An Accepted ADR is
normative until a human supersedes it, so a contradiction with the code is
reported as `ADR/CODE CONFLICT` and left for decision — see the reference for
why the alternative lets an agent repeal an architectural decision by noticing
the code disagrees with it.

**Phase 3 — Regenerate the index** `docs/decisions/README.md` — the only file
this mode regenerates; an ADR `Status` line is the one other thing it may
write, and only on an explicit user decision (see the ownership table).
`docs/README.md` links to this index and is readme-owned: a stale entry there
is reported as `owned by readme, not touched`.

---

## `audit` mode

Read `references/audit-rules.md` and remain read-only for the entire mode.

**Phase 1 — Establish impact:** resolve the scope, identify the documentation
owned by or describing the changed surfaces, and load the relevant current
authorities. A code-only scope is valid: the question is whether its behavior,
architecture, configuration, operation, release process, developer workflow,
or repository structure changed in a way documentation must reflect.

**Phase 2 — Compare semantics:** verify claims in the affected documentation
against repository evidence. Report stale, contradictory, missing, or
misclassified current guidance with specific evidence. Do not duplicate
mechanical link, marker, README-rooted reachability, or ADR-index checks already owned by
`tools/scripts/check-docs-integrity.ts`, and do not judge whether code complies
with `CLAUDE.md` or an ADR — that belongs to `/luke-audit`.

**Phase 3 — Report only:** apply the findings-related protocol sections, state
the documentation-impact verdict, and emit the report in the session. Create
no report file, modify no documentation, and suggest no commit.

---

## Final report (mandatory format)

One block, for the mode that ran. Never print a block — or a counter — for a
mode that did not run: the run reports what it did, not what the skill can do.

```
=== luke-docs report — <mode> ===

  <the counter lines for that mode, from the table below>

Out of mode (not touched): <path — owned by <mode>> | none

Suggested commit:
  <the commit line for that mode, from the table below>
```

| Mode     | Counter lines                                                                                                    | Commit line                                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `readme` | `Created` / `Updated` / `Unchanged` file counts; `Sections omitted (missing info)`                                | `docs: update readme tree [luke-docs]`         |
| `inline` | `JSDoc added` / `JSDoc updated` symbols; `tRPC comments`; `Prisma fields`; `Flagged stale code`                   | `docs: normalize inline comments [luke-docs]`  |
| `adr`    | `Validated`; `Confirmed`; `ADR/CODE CONFLICT` (with evidence, awaiting decision); `Not verifiable`; `Status changed` (normally 0); `Index updated` | `docs: update adr validation [luke-docs]`      |
| `audit`  | `Documentation impact`; `Confirmed findings`; `Needs decision`; `Suppressed by baseline`; `Files written: 0`      | `none — read-only audit`                       |

The `Out of mode` line is **mandatory in every report**, `none` included: a
missing line and an empty one are different claims, and only one of them says
you looked.
