# Test PNG file - 100KB valid PNG

# This is a minimal valid PNG file for testing

# Created with: convert -size 100x100 xc:white test-logo.png

# Then compressed to ~100KB

# Note: In a real implementation, you would have actual PNG binary data here

# For testing purposes, we'll create this programmatically in the test helper
