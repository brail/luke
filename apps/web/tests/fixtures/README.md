# Test Logo Fixture

# This is a placeholder for a test logo image

# In a real implementation, you would have an actual PNG file here

# For testing purposes, we'll create this programmatically

# The file should be a valid PNG image, approximately 100KB in size

# Dimensions: 200x200 pixels

# Format: PNG with transparency

# Content: Simple logo design suitable for testing

# To create a real test logo:

# 1. Create a 200x200 PNG image with a simple logo design

# 2. Save it as brand-logo-valid.png

# 3. Ensure it's under 2MB in size

# 4. Use it in E2E tests for logo upload functionality
